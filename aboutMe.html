        <!--This section gives the user an introduction about who I am,
            what I am studying and discusses my work with iSENSE. -->
        <br>
        <p>I am currently a rising senior double majoring in Electrical 
            Engineering and Computer Science. The summer after my freshman year,
            my high grades caught the eyes of a faculty director of a program 
            called iSENSE. I was offered a co-op (and later a part-time job) 
            developing educational Android apps that upload data to iSENSE, 
            a web-system designed to help middle and high-school students and 
            teachers to share data and collaboratively investigate science 
            questions.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout the co-op I got to travel to high-schools all over the 
            state to demo my apps. I ran workshops that spark an 
            interest in computer science in high school students. 
            I loved seeing the enthusiasm and interest in student’s
            eyes. During my sophomore year, I began to get more involved 
            around school and joined a few student organizations. </p>
        
        <p>A short time after joining, I was nominated for leadership 
            positions. I became the vice-president of two student organizations:
            SWE (Society of Women Engineers) and iEEE (Institute of Electrical 
            and Electronics Engineers). Throughout my time as vice-president, 
            I helped organize professional development, philanthropy, social and
            outreach events. I love recruiting students and raising awareness to
            Engineering. I currently serve as the President of SWE. </p>
        
        <!--Parts of this paragraph are bold for emphasis.-->
        <p>Being part of SWE and IEEE gave me the power to reach out
            to so many students and influence the lives of so many people. 
            <strong>I want to be that person who leaves a mark on people’s lives. For 
            the remainder of college, I hope to continue to study the subjects 
            I love and to continue to excel in promoting them. After getting my
            bachelors degree, I want to work for a company that benefits 
            people’s lives.</strong></p>
