        <h1>Assignment 9: Notes to the Grader</h1>
        <p>Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to grade this assignment.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I ran out of time completing the assignment, so I wanted to provide you with a list of the things I was able to complete. Thanks!</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li class="completed">(4) letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the proper distribution of the letters</li>
            <li class="completed">(4) letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares</li>
            <li class="completed">(4) program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square</li>
            <li class="completed">(4) board includes bonus squares</li>
            <li class="completed">(4) score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers.
            *Score is currently implemented for the first row of the board only since it was under the basic instructions. It does compute the score correctly!</li>
            <li class="completed">(4) multiple Scrabble board lines are implemented.</li>
            <li class="completed">(2) after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand” back to 7 tiles are selected.
            *Please note, this only works for the first word. You have to press save, then the number of tiles needed to bring the hand back to 7 will be placed on the rack.</li>
        
        </ul>
